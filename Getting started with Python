You can enter commands one at a time at the command prompt ( = ).

For example: X = 7 means that X is assigned the value 7."

‚Ä¢ Python supports a wide variety of data types, including numeric, string, boolean, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and more. For data analysis, Python also uses structures like NumPy arrays (similar to vectors and matrices) and Pandas DataFrames."

üîç Explanation:
Vectors: Not a native Python term ‚Äî usually refers to NumPy arrays.

Matrices: Python uses NumPy or nested lists for this.

Data frames: In Python, these are provided by the pandas library (pandas.DataFrame).

Lists: Native to Python, like R‚Äôs generic vectors.

# create vectors

Python lists can act like simple vectors for many tasks.
Example 1 
X=5 and Y=6

# python code 
X=6
Y=5
print(X/Y)
print (X*Y)
print (X-Y)
print (X+Y)
EXample 2
# Numeric vector
Z=[20, 22, 25, 45]
S=sum(Z)
print(S)
# Character vector
Fruit= ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(Fruit)
# Logical (Boolean) vector
Logic = [True, False, True]
print(Logic)

a. Write a value 5 on Python 
b. Assign 5 to y
c. Square y
d. Assign y plus 10 to the variable x
e. Multiply y and x and assign it to z
f. Divide z to 13
g. Write sequence of integers from 1 to 12
y=5
sq=y**2
x=y+10
z=y*x
d=z/13
s= list(range(1, 13))
print(sq)
print(x)
print(d)
print(s)

# Using NumPy Array (True Mathematical Vector)
For real vector math, use the NumPy library:
import numpy as np

# Example 
vector = np.array([9, 78, 48])
print(vector * 2)      
print(vector + 5)      
print(np.dot(vector, vector))  
# To see all available functions and attributes in NumPy, type np. and then press Tab.
 Example 
np.mean(vector)    # mean
np.median(vector)  # median 
np.var(vector)     # variance 
np.std(vector)     # standar devation 
# NUMPY
NumPy stands for Numerical Python. It is one of the most important foundational packages for numerical computing & data analysis in Python.
