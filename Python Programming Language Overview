# Python
Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language developed in C. It supports both simple and complex tasks, offering a wide range of built-in modules and libraries. Python is compatible with multiple languages such as Java, C, C++, and JSON, making it versatile for various applications.

 
 In Python, you don't need to declare a variable's type because it is a dynamically typed language. For example:

x = 10
Example of Python Code:
# This is a simple Python program

#Eample 1

print("Hello, Python!")
Print(x)

#Example 2

x = 10

y = 5

sum = x + y

print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} is {sum}.")

Sum

#Simple Python Program to see if a user is eligible to vote or not.
# getting user’s name 
print("Enter your name:")
name = input()
# getting user’s age
print("Enter your age:")
age = int(input())
# condition to check if user is eligible to vote or not
if( age >= 18 ):
    print( name, ' is eligible to vote.')
    print("Hey there")
else:
    print( name, ' is not eligible to vote.')
    print("good bye")


# Basic Arithmetic

# Addition
print(5 + 3)  

# Subtraction
print(10 - 4)  

# Multiplication
print(7 * 6)  

# Division
print(20 / 4)  

# Integer Division
print(20 // 3)  

# Modulus (remainder)
print(20 % 3)  

# Exponentiation
print(2 ** 3)
